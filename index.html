        <p class="text">
          The Water Level Management System is designed to monitor and control the water levels in a reservoir or tank. It provides real-time data on water levels and automates actions based on predefined thresholds to ensure efficient water management.
          <br><br>
          We have used various sensors such as the HC-SR04 Ultrasonic sensor and the HW-038 water level sensor with their programming code files and ESP32, Arduino Uno R3 as the MCUs, the SIM800L as the SMS sending device, the I2C LCD for displaying the water levels and the LEDs that light up in response to the detected water levels.
