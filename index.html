              The Water Level Management System is designed to monitor and control the water levels in a reservoir or tank. It provides real-time data on water levels and automates actions based on predefined thresholds to ensure efficient water management.

We have used various sensors such as the HC-SR04 Ultrasonic sensor and the HW-038 water level sensor with their programming code files and ESP32, Arduino Uno R3 as the MCUs , the sim8000L as the sms sending device, the i2c lcd for displaying the water levels and the LEDs that light up in response to the detected water levels..

             Working Principle
Monitoring: Sensors continuously measure the water level and send data to the control unit.
Processing: The control unit processes the data and determines if any action is required (e.g., turning on a pump).
Control: Based on the processed data, the control unit activates actuators to adjust the water level.
Alerting: If water levels reach critical thresholds, alarms are triggered, and notifications are sent via communication modules.
Display: Real-time data is displayed on the interface for users to monitor and make informed decisions.
