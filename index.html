            <p class="text">
             
              The Water Level Management System is designed to monitor and control the water levels in a reservoir or tank. It provides real-time data on water levels and automates actions based on predefined thresholds to ensure efficient water management.

We have used various sensors such as the HC-SR04 Ultrasonic sensor and the HW-038 water level sensor with their programming code files and ESP32, Arduino Uno R3 as the MCUs , the sim8000L as the sms sending device, the i2c lcd for displaying the water levels and the LEDs that light up in response to the detected water levels..
